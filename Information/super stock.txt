HI this is Allysson and I am a senior full stack developer
I have 7 years+ experiences in web development and have worked with small, medium and large businesses across US and Europe with different industries and types building small-large scaled websites and applications.
And my strenghs are mostly both frontend and backend development with javascript, typescript and related frameworks like react, next.js and vue.js
I have developed many web and mobile frontend and backend like shopping, cooking and food delivery, education, learning, CRM, marketplaces etcc
using react and node express and other programming languages with mysql, postgresql and mongodb, I have built lots of complex logistic websites.
Espeically Nodejs and Python are my major backend skills so I am very familiar with Nestjs/typeorm, graphql, django, ruby on rails.
Additionally I am experience with cloud computings such as aws ec2, aws s3 and lamda function etc..
react is my major frontend skills so I am very familiar with react, redux, react hook, react thunk, react saga, react material UI, bootstrap and as well as typescript.
I am pretty much familiar with Python and machine learning.


Python challenge----------------------------

Yes, I have encountered some challenges while using Python, but I was able to overcome them with the help of online resources and the support of the Python community.

One particular challenge I faced was when I was working on a project that required the use of multiple libraries with conflicting dependencies. This caused errors to occur in the code, and I had to spend a lot of time debugging it. To fix the issue, I researched the problem online and found that defining the specific versions of each library in the project's requirements file could help.

Another challenge I faced was optimizing performance for computationally demanding tasks. To resolve this, I used the NumPy and Pandas libraries, which are designed to boost performance and improve data processing speed.

Lastly, I encountered difficulty while learning to use certain libraries with complex APIs. To address this, I referred to detailed documentation and example code, which helped me in understanding and properly implementing the libraries.

I have built head-to-head survey web platform named PollThePeople (https://pollthepeople.app/) with React and ChatGPT plugin. In this project, I have integrated analytics system to show responser's semantic and so on. I also built chatbot can answer any question about responses of responsers.
